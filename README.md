Created by James Philip 27/05/2020

This project simulates an ATM machine.

The user is able to create an account and then log in into the main menu. From here the user can use the following options:
 1. Withdraw money
 2. Add money 
 3. Check balance
 4. Transfer money
 5. Log Out
 
 Logging was initialised to track the ATM use.
